## What is this?

**Hayalo Behave** is a Discord bot that gives every member a behaviour score between 0 and 12,000 — starting at 10,000. Good participation earns points. Toxic behaviour loses them. The whole server can see everyone's score at any time.

It works like Dota 2's behaviour score system: passive gains for activity, commendations from peers, and reports that hit hard and fast.

> Scores are per-guild and fully persistent.  
> Nothing carries over between servers.

---

## How it works

```
  SCORE PIPELINE
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Activity  →  Passive gains  →  Peer tips/reports  →  Score change  →  Public log
```

| Trigger | Effect |
|---|---|
| First message of the day | +20 |
| Active in the last hour | +5 (max +50/day) |
| Receiving a reply | +30 |
| Receiving a reaction | +10–25 depending on type |
| Someone tips you `/tip` | +100 |
| Someone reports you `/report` | −300 + public announcement |
| Spamming messages | −100 |
| Swearing | −50 |
| Using bot commands outside the designated channel | −50 |
| Sending only `?` | −25 |
| Reporting the same person twice in 24 hours | −200 to the reporter |

A weekly digest posts every Monday summarising score distribution and top movers. When a tip or report targets someone in a voice channel, the bot joins and announces it with TTS.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites — FFmpeg

FFmpeg is required for voice TTS announcements.

| OS | Command |
|---|---|
| **Debian / Ubuntu / WSL** | `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg` |
| **macOS** | `brew install ffmpeg` |

Verify with: `ffmpeg -version`

---

### 1 · Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hayalo-behave.git
cd hayalo-behave
```

---

### 2 · Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3 · Configure your credentials

Create a `.env` file:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
SPAM_MESSAGE_LIMIT=5
SPAM_TIME_WINDOW=5
```

---

### 4 · Add sound files

Place MP3 files at `sounds/tip.mp3` and `sounds/report.mp3`. These play in voice channels when tips and reports are triggered. If either file is missing, that voice step is skipped silently.

---

### 5 · Set up the Discord application

1. Go to [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create an application
2. Under **Bot**, enable **Server Members Intent** and **Message Content Intent**
3. Under **OAuth2 → URL Generator**, select scopes `bot` and `applications.commands`
4. Required permissions: `Send Messages` · `Read Message History` · `View Channels` · `Connect` · `Speak`
5. Use the generated URL to invite the bot to your server

---

### 6 · Run

```bash
python main.py
```

Slash commands sync to all guilds on startup. On first run, no channels are configured — use `/setup` in Discord to complete setup.

---

### 7 · Configure in Discord

Run `/setup` and select your channels from the dropdowns:

- **Report channel** — where public report announcements are posted
- **Digest channel** — where the Monday weekly digest is posted
- **Bot channel** *(optional)* — restrict commands to one channel; using them elsewhere costs −50

Run `/bot-check` to verify everything is working.

---

## Running with Docker

Docker bundles FFmpeg and all dependencies — no local install needed.

```bash
# Build and start
docker compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop
docker compose down

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose up -d --build
```

The `data/` and `sounds/` directories are bind-mounted so the database and sound files survive rebuilds. Place your MP3 files in `sounds/` on the host before starting.

---

## Notes

- Scores are isolated per guild — a user's score in one server does not affect another
- Swear cooldown is 60 seconds per user — rapid-fire swearing counts as one penalty window
- Spam and swear cooldowns are in-memory and reset on bot restart
- All score changes are logged to `score_events` with a reason and source for full auditability
- The weekly digest runs every Monday at 08:00 Europe/Stockholm

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- FFmpeg (system install)
- Discord bot token
